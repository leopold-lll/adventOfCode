# Advent of Code (AOC)
This repository contain my attempt to participate in the [AOC competition](https://adventofcode.com/)!

- [AOC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
- [AOC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
  A [repository of very well implemented python solutions for the AOC 2024](https://github.com/RD-Dev-29/advent_of_code_24/tree/main).

There is a problem for each day and folder for each year and problem (no more restriction).

Enjoy :D
